The function has parameters inside that can be controlled in a material instance. \nThe maxTessFactor is 15 by default IN ENGINE because it gets slower if you go higher on AMD cards. You can change the maxTessFactor by editing the FlatTessellation.ush and PNTriangles.ush files and then recompiling EVERY engine shader. \nvThe height is multplied by the tessellation factor, so the less you tessellate, the heightmap gets applied less. This also works with landscapes if you use Worldposition-XY coords instead of LandscapeLayerCoords.",
